So, where should I start?

My name is Ziwen Song. But I prefer Michael for those having difficulty pronoucing Chinese name properly.
I majored in Physics in college, which trained me to look at the world through a Physics lens.

It took several years of exploring the possiblity before I settled on making games as a career. But I'm always
curious about things and want to know more about things that have intrinsic value.
